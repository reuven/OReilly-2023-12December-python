    "- Strings, which contain characters and are immutable\n",

    "- Tuples can contain anything (like lists) but are immutable (like strings)\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Lists are for sequences where all values are of the same type\n",
    "- Tuples are for sequences where the values are of different types\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are Python's records or structs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you use a list with different types? Yes. Can you use a tuple with the same type? Yes. But the convention is there, and it's worth paying attention to, especially for lists."

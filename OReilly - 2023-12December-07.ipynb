      "source": "# What is programming? What is Python?\n\nWhen computers were invented, each computer could solve one problem using hardware.  If your program changed, you needed to change your computer, physically!\n\nVery soon, people realized that it was better to have a general-purpose computer, and then to write different programs using languages.\n\nThe computer uses 1s and 0s for its instructions and data.  Can you write instructions using 1s and 0s? Yes, but it's really hard!\n\nProgramming languages were invented: You write in a high-level, English-like language, and the language is then translated into 1s and 0s.\n\nThere are many thousands of programming languages. Each expresses things a bit differently. Each has different advantages and disadvantges:\n\n- C runs very very fast, but is very hard to learn, and very hard to debug.\n- Java runs pretty fast, but it uses only object-oriented programming, which can be hard to learn.\n- Python doesn't run all that fast (although it's getting better). Its big advantage is readability.  It's extremely consistent and easy to understand.\n\nLow floors and high ceilings -- it's easy to get in and understand, but it doesn't have any real, inherent limits.\n\nWhere is Python used?\n\nPython is perfect for places where people are expensive and computers are cheap.  In Python, you can write and maintain your programs very quickly -- saving you on people time.  If it runs a bit more slowly... that's usually OK.\n\nPython's domains nowadays include:\n\n- Education\n- Web applications\n- Data science and machine learning\n- Automated testing\n- Devops\n\nPython is an open-source language. Yes, that means it is free of charge! But it's also maintained and developed by the people who use it.\n\n# Two ladders\n\nI think of learning a programming language as being like learning a foreign language.  That means: Lots of practice! Lots of mistakes!\n\nIf you had to learn a foreign language without a mother tongue, it would be very hard!  If you already know a language, you can say, \"This is a noun, or a verb, or an adjective.\"\n\n",

If the variable has been defined, then it now has a new value.\n\nA few things to notice about Python variables:\n\n- We don't need to declare them in advance; the first time they're assigned to, they are created.\n- Variables don't have types. Any variable can refer to any type of data in a Python program -- number, text, list, dict, etc.\n\n## Variable names\n\n- You can use any letter, digit, or `_` (underscore)\n- `_` is treated specially at the start or end of a variable name; try not to use it there\n- You should start a variable with a letter\n- Capital and lowercase letters are DIFFERENT to Python\n- Normally, we only use lowercase letters and `_` (and maybe some digits) in our variable names\n- If you want more than one word in your variable, then use `_` between those words\n- Variables *never* have quotes around their names. Strings (text) must have quotes around its content.  That's how we can distinguish between variables and text.",

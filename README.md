# Jupyter notebook from my "First Steps" training

This repo will contain the Jupyter notebooks and other materials for my December training at O'Reilly.

I'll be using Noteable (https://app.noteable.io/) for my notebooks, and I encourage you to try it, too! (The free plan is more than enough for our purposes.)

Notebooks:

- Day 1, Thursday December 7: https://app.noteable.io/f/b407c799-da89-4d75-bebe-7265dbf137e5/OReilly---2023-12December-07.ipynb
